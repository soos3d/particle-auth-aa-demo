# Particle Auth, Account Abstraction SDK, Next.js, and ethers V6

‚ö°Ô∏è Basic demo application using `@particle-network/authkit` and `@particle-network/aa` to initiate social login and send transactions via an account abstraction smart account.

This app allows you to log in using social logins and interact with the Ethereum Sepolia and Base Sepolia testnets by displaying account information and sending a transfer transaction to an address you can input in the UI. The user can select to send a gasless transaction or pay gas with the native token.

> This demo showcases the upgrade process from the deprecated `auth-core-modal` SDK to the new `Authkit` SDK.

> üõ†Ô∏è Try the Next JS demo: [Particle Auth Next.js AA demo](https://iotex-particle-auth-aa-demo.vercel.app/)

Built using:

- **Particle Auth Core**
- **Particle AA SDK**
- **ethers.js V6.x.x**
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

## üîë Particle Authkit

Particle Authkit enables seamless onboarding to an application-embedded **MPC-TSS/AA** wallet facilitated by social login, such as Google, GitHub, email, phone number, etc.

üëâ Learn more about [Particle Auth](https://developers.particle.network/docs/building-with-particle-auth).

## ü™™ Account Abstraction SDK

Particle Network natively supports and facilitates the end-to-end utilization of ERC-4337 account abstraction. This is primarily done through the account abstraction SDK, which can construct, sponsor, and send UserOperations, deploy smart accounts, retrieve fee quotes, and perform other vital functions.

> Every gasless transaction is automatically sponsored on testnet. On mainnet, you'll need to deposit USDT into Paymaster.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quickstart

### Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/soos3d/particle-auth-aa-demo.git
```

### Move into the app directory (Next JS)

```sh
cd particle-aa-nextjs
```

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

Or

```sh
npm install
```

### Set environment variables
This project requires several keys from Particle Network to be defined in `.env`. The following should be defined:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID`, the ID of the corresponding application in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_KEY`, the ID of the corresponding project in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).
-  `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`, the client key of the corresponding project in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).

Use the following if you are setting up the React Native application

- `REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID`, the ID of the corresponding application in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).
- `REACT_APP_CLIENT_KEY`, the ID of the corresponding project in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).
-  `REACT_APP_APP_ID`, the client key of the corresponding project in your [Particle Network dashboard](https://dashboard.particle.network/#/applications).

### Start the project
```sh
npm run dev
```

Or

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Development Next JS

Particle Auth config is in `src/app/layout.tsx`. 

## Development React

Particle Auth config is in `src/app/index.tsx`. 

### Config social logins

List of available social logins:

```sh
{
  email: 'email',
  phone: 'phone',
  facebook: 'facebook',
  google: 'google',
  apple: 'apple',
  twitter: 'twitter',
  discord: 'discord',
  github: 'github',
  twitch: 'twitch',
  microsoft: 'microsoft',
  linkedin: 'linkedin',
  jwt: 'jwt'
}
```

### AA options

You can configure the smart account using the `aaOptions` object in `src/app/page.tsx`.

- **BICONOMY**, a [Biconomy smart account](https://www.biconomy.io/smart-accounts).
  - `version`, either `1.0.0` or `2.0.0`; both versions of Biconomy's smart account implementation are supported.
  - `chainIds`, an array of chain IDs in which the smart account is expected to be used.
- **CYBERCONNECT**, a [CyberConnect smart account](https://wallet.cyber.co/).
  - `version`, currently only `1.0.0` is supported for `CYBERCONNECT`.
  - `chainIds`, an array of chain IDs in which the smart account is expected to be used.
- **SIMPLE**, a [SimpleAccount implementation](https://github.com/eth-infinitism/account-abstraction/blob/develop/contracts/samples/SimpleAccount.sol).
  - `version`, currently only `1.0.0` is supported for `SIMPLE`.
  - `chainIds`, an array of chain IDs in which the smart account is expected to be used.

```ts
  // Set up and configure the smart account
  const smartAccount = new SmartAccount(provider, {
    projectId: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID!,
    clientKey: process.env.REACT_APP_CLIENT_KEY!,
    appId: process.env.REACT_APP_APP_ID!,
    aaOptions: {
      accountContracts: {
        SIMPLE: [
          {
            version: "2.0.0",
            chainIds: [IoTeXTestnet.id, IoTeX.id],
          },
        ],
      },
    },
  });

  // Use this syntax to upadate the smartAccount if you define more that one smart account provider in accountContracts
  //smartAccount.setSmartAccountContract({ name: "SIMPLE", version: "1.0.0" });
 ```
